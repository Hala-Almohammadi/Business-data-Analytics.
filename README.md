project 1 -Interpret a Data Visualization.


A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, weâ€™ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

project 2 - Analyze NYSE Data.


For the final project, you will conduct three tasks:
1) complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings
2) develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement 
3) create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming which sub-category and company you want to focus your data analysis on - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to conduct your analysis and choose a sub-category and company you are most interested in. This project is open-ended in that there is no one right answer.

project 3 - Predicting Diamond Prices.


A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

Project 4 - Build Data Dashboards.


In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
